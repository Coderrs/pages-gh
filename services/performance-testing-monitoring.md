## Performance Testing

---



Performance is one of the greatest challenges in operating a reliable system.
Usually, services aren't just all up or all down. Instead, they get slow. Some of the components go down and then some others get overwhelmed due to increased workload, scalability, and so on.
To remain operational with the utmost service reliability, you need to start with a complete view of the problem. Moreover, you need understanding and experience with the same or similar systems.
For example, knowing this that for most web apps, 80 to 90% of the actual latency observed by end-users was the front end, and to know enough monitoring systems to improve performance is always the best step forward.

AVCS’s emphasizes on not spending too much time on the parts that aren't most of the problem. Instead, our focus will always be on what is especially important to performance.
This is because we understand performance optimization is all about achieving the business goals from the software.

The increasing complexity of software and varying set of business goals makes it necessary that each software system is assessed thoroughly for the performance before it is released to the market.
AVCS’s performance engineering practice is a systematic, quantitative approach to the cost-effective development of software systems to meet performance requirements.

AVCS’s performance engineering Center of excellence will help your organization to evaluate your software through performance testing and monitoring and improvise it by adopting performance tuning and engineering measures.

### How we can help!

AVCS community of performance engineers comes with an in-depth understanding of the service-oriented (SOA), monolithic, or microservice-based architecture and extensive experience in programming development languages.

Performance testing, on the other hand, is carried out to simulate how a system will perform under production loads and to predict probable cause failure due to heavy load conditions.
Depending upon the architectural choices, platforms or programming languages, AVCS community of performance engineers can provide your organization cost-effective performance improvement solutions from a wide range of opensource tools such as Gatling, Locust, JMeter, Artillery, Blazemeter, etc.
AVCS performance engineering service is a systematic, cost-effective approach to managing software systems performance. Engaging AVCS can reduce project costs and eliminate project failures due to performance problems. We will help you to improve your level of service to customers, reduce business costs, help you use computer resources more efficiently, and improve your competitive position.
