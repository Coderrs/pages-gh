## Performance Testing
---
##### Performance engineering is a systematic, quantitative approach to the cost-effective development of software systems to meet performance requirements.

##### The scope of end to end performance engineering involves focus on architecture, design, and implementation choices.

##### AVCS community of performance engineers comes with in-depth understanding of the service oriented (SOA), monolithic or microservice based architecture. We at AVCS understands that Performance engineering is driven by business requirements. The aim is to provide better business value for the organization by discovering potential issues early in the development cycle.

##### Performance testing on the other hand is carried out to simulate how a system will perform under production loads and to predict probable cause failure due heavy load conditions.

##### Depending upon the architectural choices, platforms or programming languages, AVCS community of performance engineers can provide your organization cost effective performance testing solutions from wide variety of opensource tools such as Gatling, Locust, JMeter, Artillery, Blazemeter etc.
