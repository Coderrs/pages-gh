## Performance engineering and testing

Performance engineering is a systematic, quantitative approach to the cost-effective
development of software systems to meet performance requirements.

The scope of end to end performance engineering involves focus on architecture, design, and
implementation choices.

AVCS community of performance engineers comes with in-depth understanding of the service
oriented (SOA), monolithic or microservice based architecture. We at AVCS understands that
Performance engineering is driven by business requirements. The aim is to provide better
business value for the organization by discovering potential issues early in the development
cycle.

Performance testing on the other hand is carried out to simulate how a system will perform
under production loads and to predict probable cause failure due heavy load conditions.

Depending upon the architectural choices, platforms or programming languages, AVCS
community of performance engineers can provide your organization cost effective
performance testing solutions from wide variety of opensource tools such as
Gatling, Locust, JMeter, Artillery, Blazemeter etc.

AVCS performance engineering service is a systematic, cost-effective approach to managing
software systems performance. Engaging AVCS can reduce project costs and eliminate project
failures due to performance problems. We will help you to improve your level of service to
customers, reduce business costs, help you use computer resources more efficiently, and
improve your competitive position.Â
