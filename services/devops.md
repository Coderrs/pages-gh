It is all about Continuity, whether it is Development, Support, Security or Infrastructure.

We specialize in automating the IT requirements, whether it is On-Prem or Cloud and Our Architecture is based on Future proof systems.

## What is Future Proof System?

Systems which offers ease of change and upgrade during its operational lifetime are
identified as future proof system. These systems are scalable, extendible, upgradable and
permits addition of new features or new technological components.

- Scalable – System should be able to scale individual components (Microservices) on demand, i.e. based on concurrent users or some external event.
- Extendible – System should allow features as pluggable components to provide more specialized behaviour.
- Upgradable – Seamless upgrade to one or more Microservices or specific components in a System without affecting other components.
- Permits new features or Technological components – System’s infrastructure should be managed as IaC (Infrastructure as code) this facilitates declarative integrations with legacy and future components alike.

A future proof system allows incorporation of new capabilities. These capabilities are often
a set of additional features required by one or more system components. Features for an 
application or extension of an existing component is required to be developed and deployed
with minimum disruption to an existing architecture and keeping the security intact. This
becomes a challenging task for technical architects and lead developers as to baseline the
architecture and strategize the process in an event of technology migration or upgrade to
various infrastructure components.

## How can we help ?

AVCS community of Software engineers comes with in-depth understanding of scalable
Microservice Architecture, Serverless Computing, Streaming Platforms, Event driven
services, System migration from Monolithic to Microservice, Implementing SSO (Single Sign
On) using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and JWT (JSON web token), and
implementing authentication and authorization across third party services, integrating
Mainframe based legacy system like ICBS (AS400) and VisionPlus to expose APIs using JCA
(Java EE Connector Architecture) via SOAP and REST protocols.
Depending upon the architectural choices, platforms and programming languages, AVCS
community of performance engineers can provide your organization cost effective cloud
hosted solutions from a wide range of opens source technology and tools such as NodeJS,
NginX, MongoDB, Postgres, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) , Apache Kafka,
Jenkins, Nexus, Spring boot and Java 8.
Engaging AVCS can reduce project costs and eliminate project failures due to design and
architecture problems. We will help you to improve your level of service to customers,
reduce business costs, help you use computer resources more efficiently, and improve your
competitive position.

AVCS Offerings in Design and Development of Cloud Services
-  Assessment of existing IT Infrastructure.
-  Migrate existing IT Infrastructure across different Cloud Hosting providers like AWS, Azure, GCP and DigitalOcean etc.
- Build Future Proof systems by implementing Microservice Architecture.
- Secure IT systems against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
