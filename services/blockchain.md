## Hyperledger Blockchain Solutions

##### At the heart of a blockchain network is a distributed ledger that records all the transactions that take place on the network.
##### A blockchain ledger is often described as decentralized because it is replicated across many network participants, each of whom collaborate in its maintenance. Weâ€™ll see that decentralization and collaboration are powerful attributes that mirror the way businesses exchange goods and services in the real world.
